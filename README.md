To whoever basks upon this hot mess of code right here, I feel sorry for you.

As usual though, the reason this is public is so others might take inspiration from my work and possibly learn from it. Please do NOT blatantly copy it and render out the animation to post on your own social media, or I'll stop making these codes public, and throw a banana at you.
